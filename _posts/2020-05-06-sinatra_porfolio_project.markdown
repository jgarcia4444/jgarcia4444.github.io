This project was fairly enjoybale to me. Being able to see the result of your code displayed in a web browser is very exciting and reinforces how much we are able to learn. While in the process of completing this project a few other ideas came into my head of how I could use Sinatra and what I could build. This project has also reinforced the art of refactoring to me. When I first got the project working how I wanted it to the code was hard to follow along. Once I went through it twice and grouped different bits of logic together it made the code much more readable. Now if I wanted to go back and add features or change how something worked it would be much easier because of the refactoring. I can't wait to move onto Rails and see how much more I can improve.
