I started to learn software development because most of my life I have had an aptitude for logical problem solving,  science, and lately I love to learn and the consistency it takes to fully grasp a concept.  I realized right away that to be a software developer you have to constantly be learning. Due to the constant innnovation of technological hardware and software as a developer you have to keep up. I also am a technology nerd, so all these factors have led me down this road.
