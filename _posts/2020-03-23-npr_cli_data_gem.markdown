The biggest helper to me for building this project was the flow diagram. Everytime i would be stuck trying to figure what kind of data a function should be returning I would peek back at my flow diagram and it would immediately click what the function should return. Planning was a crucial part for me because it helped me solidify what I wanted the program to do. I would code for around 30 minutes trying to implement the logic to one of my steps in my flow diagram, then I would test it out through the console to make sure I was receiving my desired results. Once I was happy with that stage of the program i would commit and push to github. Then I would look at my flow diagram again to see what kind of logic was needed for the next piece of the puzzle. Then repeat back to 30 minutes of coding and so on until I had completed the program.
